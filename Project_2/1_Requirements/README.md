# Bi-com System
## Description

As we have seen the unidirectional in Remote Keyless Entry(RKE), now in BiCom system we will witness bi-directional i.e.., information from keyfob to car viceversa. The status of the car will also be displayed on the keyfob by LED or display

## Identifying Features

* LCD display should be provided on the keyfob to display the car's status.
* High security is provided to unlock the system.
* It shall print the car's window status on LCD (Blue switch on - All led on at the same time)
* It shall print the car's alarm status on LCD (Blue switch press two times - All led off at the same time)
* It shall print the car's battery information on LCD (Blue switch press three times - All led on in clockwise manner)

## State of art

An RKS, which is widely used in automobiles, accomplishes the tasks of a traditional car key without requiring physical touch. Pressing a button on the remote while within a few yards of the automobile can lock or unlock the doors, as well as conduct other operations. A remote keyless entry system (RKE) that unlocks the doors and a remote keyless ignition system (RKI) that starts the engine are both part of a remote keyless system.
