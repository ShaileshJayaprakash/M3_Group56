## State of art

An RKS, which is widely used in automobiles, accomplishes the tasks of a traditional car key without requiring physical touch. Pressing a button on the remote while within a few yards of the automobile can lock or unlock the doors, as well as conduct other operations. A remote keyless entry system (RKE) that unlocks the doors and a remote keyless ignition system (RKI) that starts the engine are both part of a remote keyless system.
